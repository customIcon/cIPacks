# You need to put your pack folder here. Note that it needs a [manifest](https://github.com/customIcon/customIcons/wiki/Working-with-Icon-Packs-and-cIPackStore#making-an-icon-pack).

## You need to fork this repo first before putting the pack folder, then create a pull request. If it is approved and merged, the workflow will automatically make changes to your pack and the JSON file.
## DO NOT DO ANYTHING AFTER PUTTING THE PACK HERE!
