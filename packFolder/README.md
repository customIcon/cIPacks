# Publishing a pack
Publishing a pack is easy, but you should follow these steps

## Prerequisites
- A icon pack in folder with a [manifest](https://github.com/customWin/customIcons/wiki/Working-with-Icon-Packs-and-cIPackStore#making-the-customiconpack-manifest)
- A basic knowledge on git
- [Forked cIPacks repo](https://github.com/customWin/cIPacks/fork)
- And, a positive attitude

## Steps
1. With your icon pack folder, add `cI.` on the start of the folder name
2. Either upload it, or:
   - clone the forked repo using `git clone`, then
   - copy the pack folder in this directory, and
   - use `git add` to add the folder and files. 
3. Push it with `git commit && git push` or push it yourself if you uploaded the folder directly
4. [Create a Pull Request!](https://github.com/customWin/cIPacks/compare)
